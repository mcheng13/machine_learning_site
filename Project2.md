Here is my submission for the Jump Start Data Science Summer Program competition. I call this piece *Busy Busy Night*, as it uses a desktop for the content image and Van Gogh's *Starry Starry Night* as the style image. My inspiration for this was partly the fact that I have a crazy sleep schedule where I am awake all night and sleep during various parts of the day. It is also a play on the fact that we have a very busy schedule this summer, with the courses fitting all their content in a five week span. This stylized image is supposed to be what our vision looks like after sitting at the computer for hours after our bedtime due to various issues with our coding. I chose Starry Starry Night because I liked the color palette as well as the flowing lines, which were applied to the content image just as I had hoped they would!

Here is the result of applying deep dream to the same content image. Although I think it also looks really cool, almost how a cartoon would draw cyberspace, I don't think it has the same feel as my other image. Despite this, I still wanted to include it in my submission.
